## Running the application on Windows

The application was packaged as a macOS executable using [py2app](https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Although it hasn't been tested, the source code (available from the Code tab above) should run on a Windows machine from a Python 3 command line. The only files needed are the three .py files and the img folder:

* Select Download ZIP and save the file to your hard drive.
* Execute the following command in a Windows terminal:
`python3 pandemic.py`
